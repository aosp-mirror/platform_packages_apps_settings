/**
 * Helper class to isolate the work tracking all of the {@link Slice Slices} being loaded.
 * <p>
 *     Uses a {@link CountDownLatch} and a {@link Set} of Slices to track how many
 *     Slices have been loaded. A Slice can only be counted as being loaded a single time, even
 *     when they get updated later.
 * <p>
 *     To use the class, pass the number of expected Slices to load into the constructor. For
 *     every Slice that loads, call {@link #markSliceLoaded(Uri)} with the corresponding
 *     {@link Uri}. Then check if all of the Slices have loaded with
 *     {@link #isPanelReadyToLoad()}, which will return {@code true} the first time after all
 *     Slices have loaded.
 *
 * @deprecated this is no longer used after V and will be removed.
